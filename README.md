# CMPG 323 Individual Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository! This README.md file provides essential information about the structure of my repository, my project's integration, branching strategy, .gitignore usage, and how I handle sensitive information.

## Project Repository

I will maintain the following repositories for my CMPG 323 individual project:

1. Project 1: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-1.git)
2. Project 2: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-2.git)
3. Project 3: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-3.git)
3. Project 4: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-4.git)
4. Project 5: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-5.git)

## Project and Repository Integration

Below is a diagram illustrating how I am integrating my project within my repository:


## Branching Strategy

I will follow a branching strategy to keep my codebase organized and facilitate my project's development:

1. `main`: The main branch where stable and production-ready code resides.
2. `develop`: The development branch for ongoing work and integration of features.
3. Feature branches: Created from `develop` for specific features or tasks. Once complete, they will be merged back into `develop`.

## .gitignore Usage

I have included a `.gitignore` file in my project repository to exclude specific files and directories from version control. This helps maintain a clean repository and prevents sensitive or unnecessary files from being committed.

## Handling My Credentials and Sensitive Information

I take security seriously and follow these guidelines for handling sensitive information:

1. **Credentials**: I store sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.) in environment variables or use a secure secrets management system.
2. **Configuration Files**: I avoid hardcoding sensitive information in code. I use configuration files (e.g., `.env`) and add them to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.
3. **Encryption**: If necessary, I encrypt sensitive files before storing them in the repository.
4. **Code Reviews**: I regularly review code to prevent exposure to sensitive information.

I am committed to adhering to these guidelines to maintain the security and integrity of my project.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, I aim to manage my project effectively, maintain a clean codebase, and ensure the security of my sensitive information. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out to me.

Happy coding!
