# Project Repository Guidelines

Welcome to my project repository! This README.md file provides essential information about our repository structure, project integration, branching strategy, .gitignore usage, and handling of sensitive information.

## Project Repositories

We will maintain separate repositories for each project within our organization:

1. Project 1: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-1.git)
2. Project 2: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-2.git)
3. Project 3: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-3.git)
3. Project 4: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-4.git)
4. Project 5: [Link to Repository](https://github.com/LekgoloTumi/Project-5.git)
 
## Project and Repository Integration

Below is a diagram illustrating how our projects and repositories are integrated:


## Branching Strategy

We will follow a branching strategy to keep our codebase organized and facilitate collaboration. Each project repository will have the following branches:

1. `main`: The main branch where stable and production-ready code resides.
2. `develop`: The development branch for ongoing work and integration of features.
3. Feature branches: Created from `develop` for specific features or tasks. Once complete, they will be merged back into `develop`.

## .gitignore Usage

A `.gitignore` file is included in each project repository to exclude specific files and directories from version control. This helps maintain a clean repository and prevents sensitive or unnecessary files from being committed.

## Handling Credentials and Sensitive Information

We take security seriously and follow these guidelines for handling sensitive information:

1. **Credentials**: Store sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.) in environment variables or use a secure secrets management system.
2. **Configuration Files**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in code. Use configuration files (e.g., `.env`) and add them to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.
3. **Encryption**: If necessary, encrypt sensitive files before storing them in the repository.
4. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to prevent exposure to sensitive information.

Remember to adhere to these guidelines to maintain the security and integrity of our projects.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, we aim to streamline our project management, maintain a clean codebase, and ensure the security of our sensitive information. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to contact the project leads or maintainers.

Happy coding!
